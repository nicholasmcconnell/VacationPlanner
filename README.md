# Vacationer

## Purpose

The Vacationer app helps users find things to do and places to go when planning a vacation.  The Open Trip Map API pulls location specific data about restaurants, night life, music, hotels, and museums and displays them in a daily itinerary format. Vacation Planner simplifies the process of figuring out what to do on your next trip!

## Usage

Users will create an account and sign into Vacationer.  Once signed in, they can enter a city name, length of stay, select their interests, and submit their request. Requested information will be returned with one activity for each selected category displayed for each vacation day.  In a future version of Vacationer, users will have the ability to save those items to a printable itinerary, delete and auto-replace items they don't want in their itinerary. Additionally, past iterineraries will also be saved to the database and displayed for users to view when accesing their account.
